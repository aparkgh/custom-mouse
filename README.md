# Custom Mouse

After completing ELEC1601 and being inspired to create my own snake game in a small arduino project, I've decided to scale up things and build my own **wireless mouse**. I've specifically decided to utilise 2.4GHz to avoid bluetooth, and a battery charger with USB-C.

## ⚙️ **Components Needed**
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** (Microcontroller)
- **PAW3395 Optical Mouse Sensor**
- **NRF24L01+ Transceiver**
- **MT3608 2-24V to 5V DC-DC Boost Converter**
- **3.7V 1000mAh LiPo Battery** (and **TP4056 charger module**)
- **Omron D2F-01L Mouse Switches**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **USB receiver for NRF24L01+ (CH340 USB Module)**

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**
- unfinished :( still waiting for parts to arrive

### 1. **Component Configuration**

> ![NOTE]
> A multimeter is required to tune the DC boost converter to 5V.
